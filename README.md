## the criteria with completion 


### Application's links all function correctly.
____

* links in the navagation bar are all fully working, the links can be found inside the index.html within
the nav attribute.
### Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
* Css and html are structured to the best of my ability, keeping in mind my ability to understand code i have removed some selectors from the css that were repetitive
and fixed a couple of the attributes in the html that would make more sense for example the div being changed to nav.
### Application's CSS file is properly commented.
* the css is properly commented with every selector ,class and id hvaing a comment on whats its doing for the html. 
## Repository Quality
___
the repository follows a structure of a main folder named module 1 website which includes the html and with a sub folder named assets that contains the css folder and img folder.
my repo may not have as many repo commits due to confusion on the fork . I had all my changes fixed and was planinng to copy and paste at the end from the beginning i believe my confusion came from the intructions that said clone the starter code.
